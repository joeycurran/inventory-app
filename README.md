# Inventory App for Tara Service Station

This is a **personal project** I built for my father’s business, **Tara Service Station**, to simplify day-to-day stock management.  
It provides a lightweight, easy-to-use web interface for adding, updating, and tracking inventory, along with built-in reporting and low-stock alerts.

## Overview

Running a small service station often means juggling inventory across multiple suppliers and categories.  
This app was designed to make that process simple and visual — helping store managers quickly see what’s running low, what’s been sold, and what needs to be reordered.  

The focus is on **clarity**, **speed**, and **maintainability**, so my father and team can manage stock without technical overhead or manual spreadsheets.

This project was not created to disrupt the market, but to solve an issue with 0 licensing costs.
